A Sudoku solver that is coded using C++.
This Sudoku solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm in order to perform its task.

When entering digits for the Sudoku board, ENTER '0' FOR AN EMPTY SPACE.
DO NOT ENTER ANYTHING THAT IS LESS THAN ZERO, MORE THAN 9, OR IS NOT A NUMBER. THIS BREAKS THE PROGRAM.
