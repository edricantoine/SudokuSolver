A Sudoku solver that is coded using C++.
This Sudoku solver utilizes a backtracking, generatively recursive algorithm in order to perform its task.

When entering digits for the Sudoku board, ENTER '0' FOR AN EMPTY SPACE.
DO NOT ENTER ANYTHING THAT IS LESS THAN ZERO, MORE THAN 9, OR IS NOT A NUMBER. THIS BREAKS THE PROGRAM.

To compile/run: 

navigate to the folder with the code, and type

g++ sudoku.cpp sfns.cpp -o sudoku (or whatever the equivalent is with your C++ compiler)

./sudoku
